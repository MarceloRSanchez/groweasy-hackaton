# Contributing to GrowEasy ðŸŒ±

Thanks for taking the time to contribute!  
Below is a *thin* process so we stay fast during the hackathon.

## Branch strategy
| Purpose | Pattern | Target |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Main line | `dev` | â€“ |
| Feature / task | `feat/<topic>` | PR â†’ `dev` |
| Hot-fix | `fix/<topic>` | PR â†’ `dev` |

`main` is *release-only*: merges happen **only** via fast-forward from a tag (`v0.1-hackathon`, `v1.0`).
